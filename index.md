# The Waggle Dance - A Guide to Programming

# Intro

## What is this?
This is a highly-opinionated, curated guide to becoming a professional programmer, with a focus on fullstack web development. I originally wrote this to give some guidance to my friends. Now, I'm offering it up to the public in the hopes that it might help others. Feel free to share or offer suggestions for improvement.

## Who is this for?
This is written for people who don’t have a strong background in programming and computer science, and are trying to figure out if they want to pursue a career using programming.

## Why is it opinionated and curated?
I think exploring the world of programming-related careers can be really confusing to newbies, and it can be very easy to get lost, become overwhelmed by decision paralysis, or simply procrastinate.

This guide is aimed at helping out people with a specific goal of becoming a professional programmer by giving them a simple plan to follow, reducing choices to a handful of options selected for quality and effectiveness, and providing advice on how to actually go about the whole process.

## Some caveats
Pretty much everything in this guide is my own opinion. For conciseness, I will not be providing caveats about how certain things are my opinion elsewhere. I may omit some things. I may also be inaccurate or flat-out wrong about some things. I’m not perfect, and neither is this guide. Caveat emptor.

## Why the Waggle Dance?
The [waggle dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance) is performed by the honey bee to show other bees information to other foraging sites and colony nest locations. Similarly, this guide is meant to lead you on the journey to becoming a programmer.

## The Plan
### Level 1: Intro (2 - 6 weeks)
Try programming to figure out if a programming career is right for you.
1. Pick a first programming language (1 day)
2. Work through a short intro programming course (14 - 45 days)
3. Decide if you actually want to become a professional programmer (1 - 7 days)

### Level 2: Beginner (3 months - 2 years)
Follow a program to learn and develop useful skills in programming.
4. Research and pick an in-depth learning program (1 - 2 weeks)
5. Work through the learning program. (3 months - 2 years)

### Level 3: Intermediate (3 - 5 years)
Get a programming job, and continue to improve your skills.
6. Self-teach while you prep and apply for jobs (1 month - 12 months)
7. Work and get good at your job. (1 - 3 years)
8. Get a better job doing the kind of work you want to do (2-5 years)

### Level 4: Advanced (1 lifetime)
9. Do good in the world; hack the planet (1 lifetime)

# Level 1 - Step 1
## Pick a First Programming Language (1 day)
Much ado is made about picking a first language. There are many good choices but I’m going to narrow them down for you.

Here is a list of languages, along with generally what kind of job(s) you would likely be able to get with competency in that language:

- Javascript: Front-end web dev, full-stack web dev
- Python: Back-end web dev, data scientist, data engineer

You will be sticking with this language until you finish a short programming course (14 - 30 days). Once you’ve picked, don’t switch languages until you finish the intro course. In fact, don’t switch languages unless you hate the language you’ve been learning and can pick out a language that you’re really excited to learn. When you're first starting out, being consistent and gaining fluency in a single language is important.

You have until the end of today to pick a language.

If you have hit the end of the day without choosing a language, I’m going to pick for you: Congratulations, you’re going to learn Javascript!

## More Info
Below is more information about the languages, to help you make up your mind.
### Javascript
#### Pros
- Extremely popular
- Easiest to get a decently-paying job

#### Cons
- Kind of a quirky language, even with a lot of modern improvements, so:
	- It’s a little harder to pick up as a first language
	- It can be a little difficult to pick up other languages
- Constant, rapid change in the ecosystem can be tiring to keep up with

#### Job prospects
- Web development
	- Is basically the only language used for front-end web development
	- Can be used for back-end web development
	- Lots of startup jobs use JS primarily, as do a fair amount of jobs at mid-size and large companies
- Mobile & desktop apps - a small but rapidly growing area

### Python
#### Pros
- Very popular
- Easy to learn
- Translates pretty well to learning other dynamic languages, and to a lesser degree compiled languages
- Really useful in technical assessments.

#### Cons
- Fewer jobs than Javascript (but still a lot!)
- Slower development in the ecosystem

#### Job prospects
- Back-end web app dev
- Data science
	- Moderately difficult to get a well-paying job in data science without a college degree due the need to have other specialized skills (good knowledge of algorithms & data structures, statistics, theoretical math, etc.)

# Level 1 (Intro) - Step 2
## Work through a short intro course on programming using your programming language (14 - 45 days)
## Instructions
Decide whether you want to learn primarily through a video lecture series or a book/text-based course. (If you're not sure, try the video lectures first.) Start the course for your language and start working through the program as fast as possible.

## Rules
- Until further notice, you are now banned from copy-pasting any code. Every bit of code you use must be hand-typed. This will help you ingrain programming syntax into your brain.
- Your goal every day is to work at least 5 minutes per day EVERY DAY. Use a timer to make sure you do at least 5 minutes.
- Use a paper calendar to make sure you hit your goal every day and remind yourself.
- If you screw up and skip a day or days, forgive yourself and then, that day, return to doing 5 minutes of work every day.
- Set up a time when you are supposed to start working on the course every day. Stick to that time.

## Courses

### On completion
Congrats, you should now have an idea if you can handle learning to be a software developer and want to dig deeper.

# Level 1 (Intro) - Step 3
## Decide if you want to pursue a tech career (1 - 7 days)
Now that you've finished the intro course, it's time to sit down and figure out if you want to seriously pursue programming as a skill and tech as a career. Spend time researching and considering carefully.

If you do, keep using this guide. If not, bail and figure out what else you want to do with your life.

# Level 2 (Beginner) - Step 4
## Choose a primary method for developing employable skills (7 days - 14 days)
So you’re going for it, and committing yourself to learning programming and building a career in tech. This is a serious commitment of time, energy and money, and you should put effort into figuring out a primary way to develop employable skills. Set up some coffee interviews to find out more about the industry and how to develop your skills. Read on r/cscareerquestions and r/learnprogramming.

The options to consider are:

- Self-study
- Coding bootcamp
	- In-person
	- Online
- Courses at your local community college
- Post-baccalaureate program at a university
- Bachelor’s degree at a university
	- In-person
	- Online
- Master's degree at a university
	- In-person
	- Online

## Coding Bootcamps: Things to Consider
Whether coding bootcamps are worth it is a hot-button issue. Here are some considerations if you're thinking about going to a bootcamp. I will definitely say that there is a huge variance in quality between bootcamps, so if you decide to go this route, choose carefully.
- Cost
	- How much is it?
	- Do they have scholarships, grants, or fellowships you could apply for?
	- Would you need to take out a loan? What would the rates be for this loan?
- Program application deadlines & start dates
	- Bootcamps usually run by cohorts so you’re going to be limited by timing.
- In-person or online
	- In-person
		- Pros
			- You get a lot more guidance and will likely learn faster
			- You have the social pressure of showing up and working every day, so it’s way harder to procrastinate.
		- Cons
			- It’s significantly harder to get into a good school.
			- You’re limited by the amount of good schools in the area (usually 1-3 in a small city, 3-8 in a big city)
	- Online
		- Pros
			- Cheaper
			- Less stressful typically
		- Cons
			- Easier to slack off and/or procrastinate
			- Slower learning pace
- Quality of the bootcamp & instructors
	- What do people who’ve gone through the bootcamp or worked at it say about it? How recent are their comments?
	- What is the general recent reputation for the bootcamp online, on Reddit, on Hacker News, and on SwitchUp, and Course Report?
	- How difficult is it to get in?
		- The best programs are fairly selective, with a somewhat difficult interview process. You need to study for these. The ones you can get into without studying are usually not worth your time and energy.
- Duration of the program
	- Programs usually run anywhere from 3 months - 1 year.
- Full-time vs. part-time
	- Full-time: You’ll learn at a very fast pace, and be prepared to get a tech job much faster
	- Part-time: You’ll be able to learn at a slower pace and thus pick up more stuff, and 
- What is the bootcamp going to teach you?
	- What’s the tech stack?
	- What kind of jobs will you be prepared for?
- How much help will they give you in getting a job afterwards?

## Self-Directed Learning
Ok, from here on in we're going to assume you're going with entirely self-directed learning.

#### Learning Programs
Check out these three web dev learning programs, and choose one to work on. I would recommend Free Code Camp if you want to stick with Javascript, and Odin Project if you want to try out Ruby. (There isn't currently a strong alternative that uses Python, but Free Code Camp should be coming out with some modules for Python in 2020.)
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
    * FCC covers HTML, CSS and Javascript, and covers a wide range of topics.
    * FCC works primarily through interactive browser exercises.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
    * The Odin Project covers Ruby/Rails, Javascript, and HTML/CSS.
    * The Odin Project does a slightly better job of covering the developer tooling ecosystem, and has you work in parallel on your own PC rather than in the browser.
- Aalto University's [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course
    * Note: This is a resource I haven't personally tested, but it looks quite good on first impression.

# Level 2 (Beginner) - Step 5
## Work through the learning program (3 months - 2 years)
Now is the time to start digging in deeper into the world of tech and building serious, job-worthy skills. This is when you should be advancing from the beginner stage into an intermediate stage.

## Tooling
Time to upgrade your tools! Check out the tools section below.

## Intermediate Topics
* Git and Github/Gitlab
* Terminal/Command Line
* HTML & CSS
* Testing basics
* Recursion
* Object oriented programming: Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
* Data Structures basics
	* Linked list
	* Stack
	* Queue
	* Binary search tree
	* AVL tree
	* Graph
	* Hash map
* Algorithms basics
	* Linear search
	* Binary search
	* Quicksort
	* Insertion/Selection Sort
	* Merge Sort
	* Radix Sort
	* Depth First Search
	* Breadth First Search
	* Dijkstra's Algorithm

# Level 3 (Intermediate) - Step 6
## Self-teach while you prep and apply for jobs (1 month - 12 months)
Congrats! You've finished the learning program from Level 2, and now you should be at an intermediate capability as a programmer.

Understand that, as a programmer, you are a craftsperson first and foremost. Now that you have all the basics down, you need to use the knowledge base you've built up to propel yourself forward.

## Mindset
Congrats! You’re off and away. Now is the time to put on the big-kid pants, step out into the world, and build, build, build. Work on making small and medium-sized projects in order to develop your craft.

### Roadmaps
By this point you should be able to self-direct your learning. For more guidance on what to learn, check out these roadmaps: [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps)
Pick one roadmap and dive right in.

### Advanced Topics
The roadmaps recommended above should give you a lot to work on, but here is a brief and incomplete list of topics you may want to look into:
* Test-Driven Development and Testing Frameworks
	* Python: Pytest
	* Javascript: Mocha
* RESTful API design and use
* GraphQL
* Database usage
    * SQL and relational databases: PostgreSQL
    * NoSQL databases: MongoDB
* Python Backend Frameworks:
	* Django (Batteries-included)
	* Flask (Lightweight)
	* Pyramid
* Javacript Web Frameworks:
    * Angular
    * React
    * Vue
* Javascript Backend Framework:
	* Express (Lightweight)

# Level 3 (Intermediate) - Step 6
## Prep for the Job Search (1 month - 12 months)
Great, you've finished the program you've chosen and should now have developed employable skills. Now it's time to prep for the job search and interview process. Browse the following:
* [Getting a Gig](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig)
* [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#book-list)

### Build a personal site/portfolio
Build yourself a personal site or portfolio page. Add personal projects you're proud of, with clean code and documentation.

### Data Structures & Algorithms
You may have noticed by now that the madness of technical interviews focuses on algorithms and data structures. On your own time, begin studying.

If you prefer video lectures:
* [Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)
This course is in JS.
* [MIT's Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)

If you prefer reading a book:
* [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)
This book is in Python, but does not focus on language-specific stuff.
* [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)
The authors provide a free interactive version of the book online, along with video instructions on some in-chapter exercises.

Alongside either, browse this:
- [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/)
- [Coding Interview Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/TSiege/Tech-Interview-Cheat-Sheet)
- [Competitive Programming Syllabus](https://gist.github.com/sharmaeklavya2/8aa2830f3a46a3f46ff249b4e1f07767)

### Surveys
Reading surveys related to your field helps you understand it better. Check out these surveys:
* [Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/)
* [State of Javascript Survey](https://stateofjs.com/)
* [Jetbrain’s Python Developer Survey 2018](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/)

### News and Culture
Immerse yourself in aspects of technology culture like programming, software engineering, hacking, and tech startups through subreddits, Hacker News, Medium groups. This will generally help you understand more about what you’re getting yourself into, help you orient your priorities, and start to accumulate a general knowledge of useful resources. In addition, it will help you “talk the talk” when you get to the job application stage, so you can be in-the-know about the tech scene.

Be careful not to spend too much time on this - no more than 30 minutes per day. This is not as important as studying and programming.

At some point along this way, you should be able to get a job. Congratulations!

# Level 3 (Intermediate) - Step 7
## Work and get good at your job. Invest in your education (1 - 3 years)
Keep pushing yourself to improve. Figure out what you want to specialize in and how you can continue to educate yourself.

Set aside some money in your monthly budget to put towards your programming education.

# Level 3 (Intermediate) - Step 8
## Get a better job doing the kind of work you want to do (2 - 5 years)
Continue to improve.

Read [Designing Your Life](http://designingyour.life/)
